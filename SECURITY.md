## Security Process

1. Security report received and assigned a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process.
2. Problem is confirmed and a list of all affected versions is determined.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for all releases which are still supported. These fixes are not committed to the public repository but rather held locally pending the announcement.
5. A new version is released for all supported versions.
6. After the release, the security vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

## Security Update Process
